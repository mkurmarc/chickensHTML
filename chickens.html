    <h1>Chicken</h1>
    <p>The <b>chicken</b> (Gallus gallus domesticus) is a type of domesticated fowl, a subspecies of the red junglefowl
        (Gallus gallus).
        Chickens are one of the most common and widespread domestic animals, with a total population of 23.7 billion as
        of 2018.[1] up
        from more than 19 billion in 2011.[2] There are more chickens in the world than any other bird or domesticated
        fowl.[2] Humans
        keep chickens primarily as a source of food (consuming both their meat and eggs) and, less commonly, as pets.
        Originally raised
        for cockfighting or for special ceremonies, chickens were not kept for food until the Hellenistic period
        (4th–2nd centuries BC).[3][4]</p>
    <p>Genetic studies have pointed to multiple maternal origins in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia,[5] but
        with the clade found
        in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa originating in the Indian subcontinent. From ancient India,
        the domesticated chicken
        spread to Lydia in western Asia Minor, and to Greece by the 5th century BC.[6] Fowl had been known in Egypt
        since the mid-15th century BC,
        with the "bird that gives birth every day" having come to Egypt from the land between Syria and Shinar,
        Babylonia, according to the
        annals of Thutmose III.[7][8][9]</p>
    <h2>Terminology</h2>

    <p>In the UK and Ireland, adult male chickens over the age of one year are primarily known as cocks, whereas in the
        United States, Canada,
        Australia and New Zealand, they are more commonly called roosters. Males less than a year old are cockerels.[10]
        Castrated or neutered
        roosters are called capons (surgical and chemical castration are now illegal in some parts of the world).
        Females over a year old are
        known as hens, and younger females as pullets,[11] although in the egg-laying industry, a pullet becomes a hen
        when she begins to lay
        eggs, at 16 to 20 weeks of age. In Australia and New Zealand (also sometimes in Britain), there is a generic
        term chook /tʃʊk/ to
        describe all ages and both sexes.[12] The young are often called chicks. Chicken originally referred to young
        domestic fowl.[13]
        The species as a whole was then called domestic fowl, or just fowl. This use of chicken survives in the phrase
        Hen and Chickens,
        sometimes used as a British public house or theatre name, and to name groups of one large and many small rocks
        or islands in the sea
        (see for example Hen and Chicken Islands).</p>
    In the Deep South of the United States, chickens are referred to by the slang term yardbird.[14]
